## Mapping Exercise IV

Continue with the model and mapping from previous exercise:

We now want to add enrollment data for each school for all 9 grades: 6 years primary (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6)and 3 years junior secondary (JS1, JS2, JS3). The data is stored in two different tables.

 * Add classification for grade with all 9 values
 * Add variable to School for enrolment.
 * Add mappings to import the enrollment data.

Run the import.

Then add two indicators that use enrollment to the Analysis module.

*IMPORTANT: Save your indicators*
