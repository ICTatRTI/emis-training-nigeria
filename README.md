#### NEMIS Project Background

NEMIS- Nigeria Education Management Information System is an expansion of acronym EMIS Education Management Information System a project started towards the end of the 1980s and consisted of three inter-connected phases. During the first phase, the requirement for information was driven by civil service reform and the need to ensure that decision-making was based on accurate and valid information. The second phase was driven more by donors and as a consequence experienced implementation difficulties due to lack of ownership and issues surrounding capacity. The most recent developments for EMIS stem from the decision in 2004 of the Federal Ministry of Education, in conjunction with the Universal Basic Education Board, to support developments at the state level to overcome mistakes of the past and involve stakeholders at all levels of the process with a continue institutional support at the central level. This strategy of decentralisation, called the "The National EMIS Framework", consists of a number of initiatives.
