## Mapping Exercise I

Create a model and a mapping with the following details:

* Add location State
* Add location LGA
* Add LGA variable 'population' (just a single value that stores overall population)
* Add LGA variable 'area' (in square km)
* Data collected in 2010 and 2011
* Hierarchy consists of State and LGA
* Download the data file population.xls
* Configure as data sources the SQL server and the Excel [population file](population.xls?raw=true).
* Define all mappings

Run the import.

In the Analysis section, create an indicator for population density (population / square kilometer) and provide the highest populated LGA in Bauchi and in Sokoto.

*Don't forget to save the indicators*
