## SQL Query Exercise II

We now want to add the count of seats to the model.

In the database we have the benches table. This table has a row for each classroom and stores the number of benches for each different bench size (one, two, three and four seaters).

* Write a query to calculate the number of seats per school.
* Make the necessary additions to the model to store seats.
* Add your query to the data source.
* Create a mapping to import the data.

Run the import and create an indicator using seats.
