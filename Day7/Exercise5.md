## SQL Query Exercise

We now want to add classrooms to the model and import the data from the classroom table.

Note how the table contains a row for each classroom - we need create a Query in the EMIS Toolbox to aggregate this to a count of classrooms per school and can then import the data using this Query.

* Add a variable for classrooms by classroom condition.
* Import data from your Query.

Run the import.

Create an indicator that shows the number of classrooms.

*IMPORTANT: Save your indicators*
